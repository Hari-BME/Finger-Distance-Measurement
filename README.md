# Thumb to Index Finger Distance Measurement
This project calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger in a video using pose estimation and computer vision techniques. 
Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage Instruction
1. Provide the path to the video file when prompted. 
2. Enter the known distance from the camera to the step length measurement in centimeters. 3. Enter the known height of the step length measurement in centimeters. 
4. Enter the focal length of the camera used. 
5. Choose whether to resize the output display. If yes, enter the desired width and height. 
6. Enter the waitkey value to control the display duration (0 to pause indefinitely, or a positive integer for milliseconds). 
7. Press 'q' to exit the program.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues or errors, try the following troubleshooting steps:
Ensure the video file path is correct and accessible.
Verify that the required libraries are installed by running pip list and checking for the presence of the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt.
Make sure the video file format is supported by OpenCV.
